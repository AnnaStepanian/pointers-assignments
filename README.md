# Pointers Assignments

Five C programming assignments demonstrating pointer concepts.

## Quick Start

```bash
make run        # Compile and run all assignments
make clean      # Remove compiled files
```

## Assignments

1. **assignment1.c** - Basics of pointers (address-of & dereferencing)
2. **assignment2.c** - Pointer arithmetic with arrays
3. **assignment3.c** - Pointers and functions (swap function)
4. **assignment4.c** - Pointers to pointers (double pointers)
5. **assignment5.c** - Strings and character pointers

## Compilation

```bash
